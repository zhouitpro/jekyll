Summary
•Block types 现在被确定为 block plugins 而不是 hook_block_info().
•Blocks now support multiple block instances, so that the same block can be placed multiple times in the same theme (or once, or not at all). Each block instance has its own configuration and can be deleted.
•Configured block instances are now stored in the configuration system
